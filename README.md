<h1>Hi!👋</h1>

<h2>📣 About Me</h2>
<p>🎓 I am Ashley O'Connor, I am currently studying for a <b>Bachelor of Information Technology</b> at <b>RMIT University</b> in Melbourne Australia through online study. I am currently driving trucks for work while I continue with my degree to be able to support my family.</p>
<break>
<p>🖥️ I have thoroughly enjoyed my subjects that require programming and web development. I am enthusiastic and take pride in my work. These sectors are the areas of work I am looking to explore before or post-degree. I have learnt <b>Python</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and some basic <b>Javascript</b>. I am continuing to develop and expand my knowledge within and outside of these sectors.</p>

<p>🌱 Outside the world of technology, I love my outdoor sports. I play <b>football</b> for my local area in the senior division, ride my <b>mountain bike</b> on-road and off-road, go <b>snowboarding</b> in the Winter and go out on the lake for some <b>water sports</b> in the Summer.</p>

<p>✈️ I love <b>travelling</b> and have already been to multiple countries. The most recent travelling adeventure I went on was to <b>Cambodia</b> for a friends wedding in 2020.
